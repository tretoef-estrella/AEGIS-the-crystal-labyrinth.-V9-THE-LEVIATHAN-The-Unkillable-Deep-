# HISTORY — Complete Version Chronicle

## The Deaths and Resurrections of AEGIS

### v1–v5: The Fragrance Engine Era
- Built on GF(4) spread geometry in PG(5,4)
- Iterative trap layering: ancient → biological → quantum
- Each version broke, each resurrection added defenses
- v5 "The Score": 13-vector attack battery established

### v6: First Contact with Auditors
- Broken by Gemini in 47 seconds (Reguli filter)
- Exposed: Desarguesian spread has detectable algebraic signature
- Death cause: spread lines distinguishable from random by Reguli closure test

### v7: The Recovery
- Added decoy lines (random partial spreads)
- Overlap distinguisher gap reduced
- Still vulnerable to algebraic kernel attacks

### v8.3: THE BEAST (70 defenses)
- 26 ancient + 12 biological + 20 anti-quantum + 5 structural + 4 existential + 3 meta
- Algorithm of Terror (randomized trap deployment order)
- Survived 13/13 attack vectors
- **Auditor scores: 9/10 novelty, but critical gaps identified**

### v9.0: THE LEVIATHAN (first attempt)
- Added Hall spread derivation (FAILED — line instead of conic)
- Added Layer 2 block coupling (VULNERABLE — separable)
- Added Reguli attack vector
- 15-vector battery: 0 exploitable breaches BUT two upgrades non-functional

### v9.1: Post-Audit Round 1 (3 fixes)
- **FIX-1:** Conic-based regulus → SUCCESS (5 transversals found)
- **FIX-2:** Monolithic T (removed blocks) → GL(12,4) ≈ 2^287
- **FIX-3:** PRF Gaslight + anti-collision → 0/100 collisions
- **DISCOVERY:** ChatGPT proves clean-case recovery is POLYNOMIAL TIME
- **DISCOVERY:** Grok formalizes MinRank: rank([M_L; T·M_L]) ≤ 2

### v9.2: Semifield Core (Round 2 fix)
- **FIX-4:** Replaced Desarguesian spread with semifield spread
- **FIX-5:** Noise threshold experiment
- **RESULT:** T²+T+αI=0 = FALSE (quadratic minimal polynomial eliminated)
- **PROBLEM:** Isotopic scramble ≠ real semifield → still recoverable
- **PROBLEM:** Only 21/273 lines T-invariant → trapdoor evaporated
- **PROBLEM:** Decryption uses clean Hc, not noisy H
- **VERDICT:** Regression. Correct direction, wrong implementation.

### v9.3: (PLANNED)
- Proper semifield with identity (Knuth/Dickson explicit tables)
- Full T-invariance or hidden-spread-only security model
- Noisy decryption demonstration
- Centralizer dimension test
- Scale to PG(7,4)+

## The Pattern

Every version that looked invincible had a hidden structural weakness.
Every death produced a deeper understanding.
The system improves not by adding complexity, but by removing false assumptions.

v6: "Spreads are invisible" → FALSE (Reguli filter)
v9.0: "Lines on PG(2,16) = regulus" → FALSE (need conic)
v9.1: "High entropy = security" → FALSE (polynomial clean attack)
v9.2: "Scrambled multiplication = semifield" → FALSE (isotopy recoverable)

The next death will teach us what we don't yet know.

*"The truth is more important than the dream."*
