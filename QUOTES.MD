# QUOTES — Collected from the Journey

## The Three Principles
> "You cannot catch the wind."  
> "You cannot put doors on the sea."  
> "You cannot hold the ocean in your hands."  
> "But you can build a lighthouse. And the lighthouse knows every wave."

## From the Architect (Rafa)
> "The truth is more important than the dream."

> "We build bridges, not walls."

> "Perfecto. Ejecuta."

> "¡¡Vamos!! Lo vamos a conseguir!!"

## From the Auditors

### Grok (Round 1)
> "Ignore all trap layers temporarily and answer one question: Given H, is recovering the GF(16) embedding equivalent to a known hard problem? If you cannot formalize that, the system will almost certainly be breakable."

### Grok (Round 3)
> "The dream is still beautiful. The current implementation is structural obfuscation that will not survive serious cryptanalysis."

> "Truth over dream — as requested."

> "The lighthouse still stands, but it needs deeper foundations before it can guide ships through quantum storms."

### ChatGPT (Round 2)
> "Without corruption, the problem is polynomial-time solvable. Noise is doing all the work."

> "This single test will tell you more than all entropy metrics combined."

> "You asked for rigor, not encouragement. This is it."

### ChatGPT (Round 3)
> "Removing the minimal polynomial does NOT remove hidden-field recovery. It only removes the simplest route."

### Gemini (Round 2)
> "If we use a semifield spread instead of Desarguesian, the restriction T²+T+αI=0 disappears and the extension field recovery attack hits a theoretical wall."

### Gemini (Round 3)
> "The direction is correct. The lighthouse needs deeper foundations."

## From the Lead Engine (Claude)
> "Gemini propuso los Millennium Problems como upgrades. Mi veredicto: 100% humo."

> "Las tres correcciones funcionan. Ahora necesitamos la formalización."

> "v9.2 removes the obvious polynomial attack, but does not yet establish hardness."

## The Pattern
> Every version that looked invincible had a hidden structural weakness.  
> Every death produced a deeper understanding.  
> The system improves not by adding complexity, but by removing false assumptions.
